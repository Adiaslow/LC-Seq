"""
Module: building_block_factory

This module defines the BuildingBlockFactory class, which is responsible for creating BuildingBlock
instances. The BuildingBlockFactory class follows the Factory Pattern and the Prototype Pattern to
allow for efficient creation and cloning of BuildingBlock instances with optional modifications.

Design Patterns:
    - Factory Pattern: Used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will
        be created.
    - Prototype Pattern: Used to create new objects by copying an existing BuildingBlock instance.
    - Singleton Pattern: Used to ensure that only one instance of the BuildingBlockCache is created.
Rationale:
    - Efficiency: Creating building blocks using a factory can streamline the process, especially
        when dealing with complex initialization logic.
    - Simplicity: The Factory Pattern simplifies object creation by encapsulating the creation logic.
    - Flexibility: The Prototype Pattern provides flexibility in creating new objects based on an
        existing prototype with slight variations, reducing the need for multiple constructors or
        factory methods.
