"""
Module: building_block_cache

This module defines the BuildingBlockCache class, which is a singleton cache for storing and
managing BuildingBlock instances. It extends the CacheSingleton.

Design Patterns:
    - Singleton Pattern: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
    - Prototype Pattern: Used to create new objects by copying an existing object (the prototype).

Rationale:
    - Efficiency: A single instance of the cache can be used throughout the application, reducing memory usage and improving access times.
    - Consistency: Ensures that all parts of the application are using the same cache, preventing inconsistencies.
    - Simplicity: Simplifies access to the cache by providing a global point of access.
